# IPONWEB
Welcome to the Python and Django Homework Repository!


``for the latest homework look`` [ðŸ¦‚](https://github.com/Leo-tumo/IPONWEB/tree/main/src/Django)

In this repository, you will find a collection of homeworks that will help you solidify your knowledge of Python and Django as you work through the tutorial. Each homework assignment will build on the concepts covered in the previous assignments, and will help you gain a deeper understanding of how to build web applications using the Python programming language and the Django web framework.

Before beginning the homework assignments, make sure that you have the following installed on your computer:

Python 3.10
Django 3.9
You can check the versions of Python and Django that you have installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

Copy code
python --version
django-admin --version
Each project homework assignment will be located in its own directory, and will include a README file with instructions on how to complete the assignment.

Good luck and happy coding!
